title: "What is the value of Kale (XKA)?"
---
Cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value. Its value doesn't come from any person or corporate entity but from broad community support as well as supply and demand. We aim to build a great community by users for users. The value of XKA is currently unknown without an exchange listing, and you should treat it as worthless internet brownie points in the most probable case.
