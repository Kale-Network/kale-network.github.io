title: "What is Kale?"
---

Kale is a direct fork of the [Chia&trade;](https://github.com/Chia-Network) Network codebase built by space farmers as a fully decentralized alternative green cryptocurrency that can be secured alongside Chia&trade; while consuming negligible additional power. We aim to be a community-driven fork reflecting the will of our users, while promoting and recognizing excellent contributions to the Chia and Kale user communities. Kale is not affiliated with Chia Network, Inc., but builds on their great open-source work.
