title: "Is it safe farming Kale with my current mnemonics?"
---

Yes! It is absolutely safe running Kale with your current mnemonics. Kale is open source and has the same kernel as Chia&trade;'s. If you are unable to evaluate the security of our changes, we recommend that you use separate private keys and plots to farm Kale.
